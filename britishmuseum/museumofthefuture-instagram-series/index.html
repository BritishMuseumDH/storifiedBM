Usually focused on one object (although sometimes featuring several), it provides a space in which to experiment with display and interpretation. Displays have featured everything from ancient African hand tools to contemporary art, from Old Masters to manga. The current display (pictured) features an enormous print by Albrecht Dürer.

Large-scale sculpture was an important feature of the great temples and tombs of ancient Egypt and was believed to be imbued with powerful spiritual qualities. Sculptures on display in Room 4 include stylised depictions of kings, deities and symbolic objects ranging from the time of the Old Kingdom to the middle of the Roman Period. There are also architectural pieces from temples and tombs.
An imposing stone bust of the great pharaoh Ramesses II presides over the room, while the world-famous Rosetta Stone (in the foreground of this pic), with its inscribed scripts, demonstrates how Egypt’s ancient form of pictographic writing was deciphered for the first time.

This photo is of the popular lion hunt reliefs. In ancient Assyria, lion-hunting was considered the sport of kings, symbolic of the ruling monarch’s duty to protect and fight for his people. The sculpted reliefs in Room 10a illustrate the sporting exploits of the last great Assyrian king, Ashurbanipal (r. 668–631 BC) and were created for his palace at Nineveh (in modern-day northern Iraq). Lachish was one of the chief cities of the kingdom of Judah in the southern Levant and in 701 BC it was captured by the Assyrian King Sennacherib (r. 704–681 BC). The siege followed the refusal of Lachish to pay tribute to the Assyrian Empire (based in modern northern Iraq) and is mentioned in the Bible. Many of the relief sculptures on display in Room 10b depict the capture of the city, alongside a selection of items and weaponry used in the siege. A 'prism' inscribed with an Assyrian account of the campaign is also on show.
The city and palace at Khorsabad (in modern northern Iraq), was built for the Assyrian King Sargon II (r. 721–705 BC). The palace entrances were originally dominated by pairs of colossal human-headed winged bulls, which were intended as guardians, accompanied by protective spirits with magical powers.

People throughout the world deal with the tough realities of life in many different ways. The displays in Room 24 explore different approaches to our shared challenges as human beings, focusing on how diverse cultures seek to maintain health and well-being.
The displays provide case studies on the theme of living and dying using material from New Zealand, Ghana, the Solomon Islands, South America and the North American Arctic.
The displays consider different approaches to averting illness, danger and trouble, and investigate people's reliance on relationships – with each other, the animal kingdom, spiritual powers spirits and the world around us.
Objects range from ancient gold pieces and sculptures to a specially commissioned art installation: Cradle to Grave by Pharmacopoeia.

           We've reached Rooms 38–39 in our #MuseumOfTheFuture series. These rooms are known as the Sir Harry and Lady Djanogly Gallery of Clocks and Watches. Mechanical clocks were invented in Western Europe in the medieval period and were first used in cathedrals and churches. This is Room 38 and shows a large reconstruction of an early clock mechanism.
