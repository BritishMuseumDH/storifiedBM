Objects in the gallery date from around 520–430 BC.","created_time":"1415118394"},"users_in_photo":[],"images":{"standard_resolution":{"height":640,"width":640,"url":"http://scontent-a.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t51.2885-15/10802460_1497349343868295_1932637284_n.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"height":150,"width":150,"url":"http://scontent-a.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t51.2885-15/10802460_1497349343868295_1932637284_s.jpg"},"low_resolution":{"height":306,"width":306,"url":"http://scontent-a.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t51.2885-15/10802460_1497349343868295_1932637284_a.jpg"}},"likes":{"data":[{"full_name":"Karen Guiden","id":"1475423808","profile_picture":"https://igcdn-photos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/10731830_386602468165499_538878142_a.jpg","username":"russianhill"},{"full_name":"Apostolis Vogiatzis","id":"501524010","profile_picture":"https://instagramimages-a.akamaihd.net/profiles/profile_501524010_75sq_1394456539.jpg","username":"tolis_vog"},{"full_name":"Iván.","id":"241364379","profile_picture":"https://igcdn-photos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/10735118_761204650593953_1944437881_a.jpg","username":"ivn1025"},{"full_name":"sunsarmi","id":"847832140","profile_picture":"https://instagramimages-a.akamaihd.net/profiles/profile_847832140_75sq_1387863455.jpg","username":"sunsarmi"}],"count":691},"link":"http://instagram.com/p/u_AX2fy4WY/","created_time":"1415118394","filter":"Normal","comments":{"data":[{"id":"849848455018546562","from":{"full_name":"Mary Chelioti","id":"41505848","profile_picture":"https://igcdn-photos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/10808917_817382968313063_269320967_a.jpg","username":"mary___poppins"},"text":"#bringthemback","created_time":"1415529852"},{"id":"849883562492266357","from":{"full_name":"Ιωάννα Έφη.","id":"407560788","profile_picture":"https://igcdn-photos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/1742560_1507795392808224_1014305144_a.jpg","username":"ion.efi"},"text":"#bringthemback #givethemback","created_time":"1415534037"},{"id":"850098255282537525","from":{"full_name":"vertigocafe1","id":"1508211381","profile_picture":"https://igcdn-photos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/10787985_391824214306190_888155881_a.jpg","username":"vertigocafe1"},"text":"Back home GREECE!!!","created_time":"1415559630"},{"id":"850511985682121766","from":{"full_name":"Vasiliki Sirrou","id":"496023132","profile_picture":"https://igcdn-photos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/10499308_308780945950721_684614947_a.jpg","username":"vasilikis4"},"text":"It's the only way to have people at your museum!

The monument is much influenced by the Ionic temples of the Acropolis of Athens and its lavish decorative sculpture, which can be seen reconstructed and displayed around the walls of Room 17, is a mixture of Greek and Lycian style and iconography.","created_time":"1415124767"},"users_in_photo":[],"images":{"standard_resolution":{"height":640,"width":640,"url":"http://scontent-a.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t51.2885-15/10729278_781880015206981_710796422_n.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"height":150,"width":150,"url":"http://scontent-a.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t51.2885-15/10729278_781880015206981_710796422_s.jpg"},"low_resolution":{"height":306,"width":306,"url":"http://scontent-a.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t51.2885-15/10729278_781880015206981_710796422_a.jpg"}},"likes":{"data":[{"full_name":"bottlo74","id":"1192857979","profile_picture":"https://instagramimages-a.akamaihd.net/profiles/profile_1192857979_75sq_1395235018.jpg","username":"marky07474"},{"full_name":"Έλενα Κρπ.","id":"297470724","profile_picture":"https://igcdn-photos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/10755894_1500207240239236_1532609134_a.jpg","username":"e.krp"},{"full_name":"vertigocafe1","id":"1508211381","profile_picture":"https://igcdn-photos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/10787985_391824214306190_888155881_a.jpg","username":"vertigocafe1"},{"full_name":"✿.｡.:*Victoria's Secret*:.｡.✿","id":"1554860103","profile_picture":"https://igcdn-photos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/10735084_846966048687979_376764270_a.jpg","username":"_victoriassecret_models_"}],"count":1050},"link":"http://instagram.com/p/u_Mh2uS4ZZ/","created_time":"1415124767","filter":"Normal","comments":{"data":[{"id":"849785508573448031","from":{"full_name":"💣Panagiotis Katsaras🔫","id":"574330113","profile_picture":"https://igcdn-photos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/10802530_1735761896648078_1898809463_a.jpg","username":"panagiotis.k"},"text":"#bringthemback#givethemback","created_time":"1415522348"},{"id":"849848777854125460","from":{"full_name":"Mary Chelioti","id":"41505848","profile_picture":"https://igcdn-photos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/10808917_817382968313063_269320967_a.jpg","username":"mary___poppins"},"text":"#bringthemback","created_time":"1415529890"},{"id":"850096741491115903","from":{"full_name":"vertigocafe1","id":"1508211381","profile_picture":"https://igcdn-photos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/10787985_391824214306190_888155881_a.jpg","username":"vertigocafe1"},"text":"Bringthemback😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡","created_time":"1415559450"},{"id":"850508451821619095","from":{"full_name":"George Dimopoulos","id":"1035912070","profile_picture":"https://instagramimages-a.akamaihd.net/profiles/profile_1035912070_75sq_1390984953.jpg","username":"dimopoulosg"},"text":"Proud to be #Greek !!! #BringThemBack !!! theacropolismuseum.gr","created_time":"1415608529"},{"id":"852394974355621162","from":{"full_name":"Magda_Thomas","id":"1136909653","profile_picture":"https://igcdn-photos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/10809714_645842522199122_2029452301_a.jpg","username":"magda_thomas"},"text":"#bringthemback  #bringthemback  By keeping them you are being disrespectful to history itself","created_time":"1415833421"},{"id":"852661555283330195","from":{"full_name":"Apostolis Vogiatzis","id":"501524010","profile_picture":"https://instagramimages-a.akamaihd.net/profiles/profile_501524010_75sq_1394456539.jpg","username":"tolis_vog"},"text":"#bringthemback","created_time":"1415865199"},{"id":"855727375869773142","from":{"full_name":"kyriakos","id":"38290611","profile_picture":"https://igcdn-photos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/10691675_532998733500834_1744036322_a.jpg","username":"kuriakos__"},"text":"#bringthemback #thiefs #stolen","created_time":"1416230674"},{"id":"855951778532525581","from":{"full_name":"Apostolis Vogiatzis","id":"501524010","profile_picture":"https://instagramimages-a.akamaihd.net/profiles/profile_501524010_75sq_1394456539.jpg","username":"tolis_vog"},"text":"#bringthemback 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢","created_time":"1416257425"}],"count":62},"location":null,"type":"image","tags":["museumofthefuture"],"attribution":null}},{"id":"546b8e91907883157c000169","eid":"6229db8364dc72ea3f990ca8","type":"image","permalink":"http://instagram.com/p/vEl1yZy4UZ/","posted_at":"2014-11-06T20:30:10.000Z","added_at":"2014-11-18T18:23:13.219Z","data":{"image":{"src":"https://storify.com/services/proxy/2/l5K0tkMwuEPxTAjgAU5xYg/http/scontent-a.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfp1/t51.2885-15/10787779_360138974155347_919121979_n.jpg","width":640,"height":640,"caption":"The next gallery on our #MuseumOfTheFuture tour is Room 18, Greece: Parthenon.\nThe Parthenon was built as a temple dedicated to the goddess Athena.
